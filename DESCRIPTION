Description: Fast generic solver for sparse group lasso optimization
        problems. The loss (objective) function must be defined in a
        C++ module. The optimization problem is solved using a
        coordinate gradient descent algorithm. Convergence of the
        algorithm is established (see reference) and the algorithm is
        applicable to a broad class of loss functions. Use of parallel
        computing for cross validation and subsampling is supported
        through the 'foreach' and 'doParallel' packages. Development
        version is on GitHub, please report package issues on GitHub.
